			<p>As an individual my personality is ISFJ-T which means I prefer to study in a quiet environment, hide their anger, prefer texting to calling, see beauty in simplicity, have little interest in going into politics. Out of this personality test; I am sensitive, emotionally expressive, empathic and less competitive. I would rather focus on social harmony and cooperation. As judging individuals, we are decisive, thorough and highly organized. valuing clarity, predictability and closure, preferring structure and planning to spontaneity. Being turbulent, we are self-conscious, sensitive to stress, success-driven, perfectionistic and eager to improve. My best method of learning is visual and auditory. Which means for me I acquire knowledge effectively with visual and hearing.  Kinesthetic learning was quite low in other words learning through a physical activity is significantly lower.</p>

		<h2><strong>Project Idea</strong><h2>

		

		<br>
		<br>
		<h2><strong>Overview</strong></h2>

			<p>In this report I will be writing about my project idea Save A Cat application. Such as the ability to link the person to the right cat for them, by matching their personality with theirs by information stored. I will be discussing my motivation for coming up with the idea of this application, along with a detailed description, obstacles that I expect to encounter, potential drawbacks, tools, technologies, skills required followed by a topic of outcome.</p>
			<br>
			<br>
		<h2><strong>Motivation</strong></h2>

			<p>The motivation around this project is; that I have worked closely with cat rescue organisations. I have seen first-hand the topics that I have discussed in this section. Frequently a cat is mismatched with an owner, which often results in the cat being abandoned, euthanised or returned to the rescue organization. Older cats that are rescued can often end up in families with young children, which is often not in the best interest of the older cat. A new owner can often lack skills in dealing with a rescue cat, understanding the need for patience. With this application, matching the potential cat owners with a compatible cat. My goal is to lessen the chance of mismatched ownership (Finlay 2019).</p>
